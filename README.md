This is the Redex model for symbolic execution of a minimal higher-order language.

To run an expression `e`:

```racket
(ev e)
```

To see the traces from running `e`:
```racket
(viz e)
```

There are examples towards the end of [`main.rkt`](https://github.com/philnguyen/ho-symexec/blob/master/main.rkt)
